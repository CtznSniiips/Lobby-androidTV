# Lobby for Android TV

A native Android TV launcher for [Lobby](https://github.com/CtznSniiips/Lobby): Continue Watching, Next Up, Live TV,
sports and Seerr discovery/requests on the home screen, backed by the Lobby plugin for Jellyfin or Emby.

This is the Android TV sibling of the Samsung/Tizen app. The plugins are shared and **need no changes**: this app is
just another caller of the same `/Lobby/*` routes with the same `Authorization: Lobby <token>` header, and the same
pairing flow (enter the server address, get a code, approve it in the plugin's admin page).

Android TV only. Not intended for phones or tablets.

## How playback works

Lobby never plays media itself. Pressing a title calls `POST /Lobby/Play`; the plugin finds the official Jellyfin or
Emby Android TV app's session by `DeviceId` and sends it a play command, then Lobby opens that app. Install the
official app on the same device alongside Lobby.

## What replaces the Tizen-only features

| Tizen (`device.js`)             | Android TV                                                                  |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Installed-app dock              | `PackageManager` query for `LEANBACK_LAUNCHER` activities (`TvDevice.dockApps`) |
| Samsung Home/Settings shortcuts | `Settings.ACTION_SETTINGS`                                                  |
| DUID for pairing                | Android ID sent as `Duid`; admin can assign the app's real `DeviceId`       |
| Art Mode + Screen saver         | The system screen saver: Screen saver button on Home, optional idle start   |
| HDMI input switching            | TV Input Framework: HDMI inputs row on Home                                  |

## Build

Open in Android Studio, or `./gradlew assembleDebug` with the Android SDK installed. CI builds a debug APK on every push.
Side-load with `adb install app-debug.apk`. To use it as the home screen, choose Lobby when the TV asks for a home app
(it declares the `HOME` category).
